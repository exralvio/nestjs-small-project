1. **File Versioning**
   How would you modify your implementation to support future versions of the input file with additional fields or changed structure?

Upgrading the version of an input file requires several changes in the codebase to accommodate the new file structure while maintaining backward compatibility. The steps involved are as follows:

a. Update parseTextData Function
Modify the parseTextData() function in import.service.ts to its updated version, parseTextDataV2().

b. Update Utility Functions
Update the following functions in import.utils.ts to handle the new file structure. Ensure each function is adjusted as needed:

getEmployeeValue() → getEmployeeValueV2()
getRateValue() → getRateValueV2()
getDepartmentValue() → getDepartmentValueV2()
getDonationValue() → getDonationValueV2()
getStatementValue() → getStatementValueV2()
c. Upgrade Controller and Endpoint Versions
Introduce a V2 version of the controller and its associated endpoints. This ensures backward compatibility with the existing V1 implementation.

d. Deprecate V1 Endpoints
Once V2 is stable and fully adopted, deprecate and shut down the V1 endpoints to streamline the system and eliminate unused code.

-----------------------------

2. **Asynchronous Exchange Rates**
   If the exchange rate data is no longer included in the file and needs to be fetched asynchronously from an external API, how would you adapt your system?

a. Create a Dedicated Exchange Rate Module and Service
Develop a new ExchangeRateModule with an associated ExchangeRateService.
The service will handle communication with the third-party API to fetch the latest exchange rate data.
Implement robust error handling and caching mechanisms (e.g., using Redis or in-memory cache) to minimize redundant API calls.
b. Integrate Exchange Rate Service into Import Workflow

Update the ImportService to include a dependency on ExchangeRateService.
In the ImportService workflow, invoke ExchangeRateService to fetch the exchange rates 
asynchronously before processing the import file.

c. Pass Exchange Rate Data to Import Processing
Once the exchange rate data is retrieved, pass it as part of the input to the import processing pipeline.
Modify existing processing logic in ImportService to utilize the fetched exchange rate data where necessary.

d. Optimize for Concurrency
Use Promise.all or other asynchronous utilities to fetch exchange rates and process the import file concurrently, if appropriate.
Ensure synchronization of data to avoid race conditions during the import process.

-----------------------------

3. **Web Interface**
   How would you allow users to upload the file via a web interface in the future?
a. Restrict File Uploads to a Single File

Ensure the file upload functionality supports only one file at a time.
Use the multipart/form-data method for handling file uploads securely and efficiently.

b. Set Maximum File Size
Define a maximum file size limit to prevent excessive memory or storage usage.
Implement server-side validation to reject oversized files and provide clear error messages to users.

c. Configure Appropriate Server Timeout
Set a reasonable server timeout duration to accommodate larger files while preventing long-running requests from overloading the system.

d. Implement a User-Friendly Loading UI
Display an advanced loading indicator during the file upload process.
Include a clear message prompting users not to cancel or navigate away until the upload is complete.

-----------------------------

4. **Scalability**
   If the file size grows significantly (e.g., contains 1M employees), what optimizations would you implement?
User Experience Optimizations
a. Asynchronous Background Processing
- Transition from direct execution upon upload to a background queueing system to handle large files.
- Enforce maximum file size limits for uploads to maintain predictable performance.
- Inform users that they will receive a notification once the processing is complete.
Upload the file to the server as the first step before initiating any processing.

Backend Optimizations
b. Efficient File Processing
- Utilize file streams to process files in chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory, reducing memory consumption.
- Implement batch processing for database operations, breaking the data into smaller chunks for insertion to prevent overwhelming the database and system resources.

Infrastructure Optimizations
c. Resource Scaling
- Scale server resources such as CPU, memory, and disk I/O to accommodate larger files and increased processing demands.
- Store uploaded files in scalable object storage solutions like AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. Use pre-signed URLs for secure and efficient file access.
- Use performance monitoring tools like AWS CloudWatch, Grafana, or Prometheus to track server performance, identify bottlenecks, and scale infrastructure proactively.
